## TO DO
* progressive slicing
* parallelizing the solver
* check the possible issue with slicing of the last and first node being connected when they are not supposed to
* Change how you define the resistance in parallel in the thesis
* Check that the resistance is calculated well by comparing with MATLAB (single pixel, branches etc.)
* Check that you get similar deposition times as in MATLAB
* Check that single sheet structures are working well
* freeze the virtualenv
